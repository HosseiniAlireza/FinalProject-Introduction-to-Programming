# Student Records Management System

## Description
A simple C++ program for managing student records, including insertion, deletion, updating, searching, and reporting, using binary file operations.

## Features
- **Create File**: Initializes a binary file to store student records.
- **Insert Record**: Add new student details (ID, name, average score, birthdate).
- **Delete Record**: Remove records based on student ID.
- **Search Record**: Search and display records by student name.
- **Update Record**: Modify existing records.
- **Show All Records**: Display all stored student records.
- **Report**: Calculate and display the average score of all students.

## How It Works
1. Student data is stored in a binary file (`test.dat`).
2. Each record includes:
   - Student ID (integer).
   - Name (up to 20 characters).
   - Average score (float).
   - Birthdate (year, month, day).
3. The program provides a menu-driven interface for performing operations on the data.
